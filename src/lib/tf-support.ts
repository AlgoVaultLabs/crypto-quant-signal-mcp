/**
 * tf-support.ts — OPS-SEED-UNSUPPORTED-TF-SKIP-W1.
 *
 * `isTimeframeFaithful(venue, tf)` — does the venue serve `tf` at a base-candle resolution FINE ENOUGH
 * that a `<tf>` win-rate is not resolution-inflated? The public, Merkle-anchored `byTimeframe` record is
 * the proof AlgoVault sells; a `5m` PFE win-rate computed on `15m` candles cannot resolve 5-minute price
 * action, and Factuality is THE LAW.
 *
 * Ratified rule (B′, architect 2026-07-23): **faithful ⇔ servedIntervalMs(tf) < 2 × TF_MS[tf]**.
 *   - A served base candle ≥ 2× the requested horizon is resolution-inflating → skip (WhiteBIT 3m/5m→15m
 *     3×/5×; PHEMEX 12h→1d exactly 2×).
 *   - A 1-step approximation < 2× is KEPT and DISCLOSED in the public methodology (XT/GATE/MEXC/HTX 3m→5m
 *     1.67×). Keeping it silently is rejected — an undisclosed 3m-WR-on-5m-candles fails a programmatic audit.
 *
 * Single-derivation: the served interval comes from each adapter's OWN fetch-map via `servedIntervalMs`
 * (see served-interval.ts). There is **no hand-maintained venue×TF faithfulness matrix** — the faithful set
 * is COMPUTED (SOP "Lessons burned in" #10; CLAUDE.md "Data-drive everything"). The `Record<ExchangeId, …>`
 * below is tsc-exhaustive, so a newly-added venue that forgets `servedIntervalMs` fails the type-check.
 *
 * Consumers: the cron seeder now (skips unfaithful pairs before `seedExchange`), and the public formatter
 * once OPS-COARSENED-HISTORY-SUPPRESS-W1 suppresses already-public coarsened rows — one predicate, so the
 * write-side and read-side can never drift to two disagreeing definitions of "faithful".
